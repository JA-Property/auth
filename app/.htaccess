# .htaccess File: Directory Access Restriction
#
# Purpose:
#   This file is used to prevent direct access to sensitive directories,
#   such as /app and /vendor, by disabling PHP processing and denying
#   all HTTP requests to these folders.
#
# How It Works:
#   1. The <IfModule> block checks if mod_php7 is enabled. If it is,
#      the "php_flag engine off" directive disables PHP execution,
#      preventing any PHP files from being executed if accessed directly.
#   2. "Deny from all" instructs Apache to block all HTTP access to the
#      directory, ensuring that no files within it can be accessed by
#      web browsers.
#
# Usage:
#   Place this .htaccess file in directories where you want to restrict
#   access (e.g., /app and /vendor). This adds an extra layer of security
#   by protecting sensitive application code and dependencies.
